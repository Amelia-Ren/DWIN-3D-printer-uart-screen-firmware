The firmware of LCMs is well matched with Marlin mainboard, which is much easier to modify. Also, it is equipped with self-developed T5L CPU that is dual-core 8051——GUI and OS cores for UI design and second development respectively. Additionaly, one of that is used in the firmware of 3D printers. Actually, it can also be modified to use in other mainboard except Marlin. Let's see how it works and make more applications basing on it.
This LCD module (UART) is developed and producted by Beijing DWIN Technology Co., Ltd (Offical Website: www.dwin.com.cn/home/English).
